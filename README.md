# ISA-lab
This repository includes four laboratory sessions of the Integrated Systems Architecture course.

## First laboratory experience 
The first laboratory activity is regarding the developing of **FIR filter**. Firstly I model it by means of Matlab,
afterwards I design its hardware implementation by using VHDL language. In addition to the basic version, an advanced
architecture was developed, by means of 3-unfolding and pipelining. All of these implementations are simulated and 
synthesized.

## Second laboratory experience

During the second laboratory activity, it was designed in System Verilog a **Radix-8 Modified Booth Encoder**
based multiplier for unsigned data, and then use it as the Mantissa multiplier for the floating point unit of
Risc-V processor. The multiplier is simulated and synthesized.

## Third laboratory experience

For what concern the third laboratory activity, a **Risc-V lite** processor is implemented in VHDL. The laboratory expect to 
compile an application called *main.c*; once doing that I obtain the sequence of instructions to execute, saved in the *my_pkg.vhd*.
